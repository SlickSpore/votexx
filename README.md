votex is a simple program which helps you to find the right vote for you in order to study less.
written by a student for students, is a simple life changin' program.
## not sure whether to study or not? 
just open a term and run `votexx-1 find v1 v2 v3`  and you'll immediately get the lowest possible vote in order to have 6 of mean, which, in most of europe's states is the least sufficient threshold in order to not be sent back to the year before lfmao.
## boring syntax:
usage:  
1. getting the mean of a particular range of votes:
`votexx-1 mean [votex, ..., votey]` 
2. finding the right vote to have a sufficient mean (6):
`votexx-1 find  [votex, ... votey]`
3. getting a weighted mean of a range of votes:
`votexx-1 wmean [(votex, w), ..., (votey, w)]`
4. EXPERIMENTAL: getting the right vote to have a sufficient weighted mean (6):
`votexx-1 wfind x, y [(votex, w), ..., (votey, w)]`
